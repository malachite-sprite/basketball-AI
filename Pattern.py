Pattern.py

The basic pattern. Each pattern consists of a list of player positions (See position.py).

Patterns are, like positions, practically immutable.

Patterns are comparable, as well. The algorithm for comparason runs as follows:
 Each position in the primary Pattern (where there ordering is, 'if primary_pattern
  equals secondary_pattern:' -- N.B. a == b is NOT the same as b == a) finds the nearest
  position in the compare_to pattern. If that position not within the tolerance then
  the two patterns are not "equal". Otherwise, move on to the next position. At the end
  of the loop, the two positions must be "equal"
