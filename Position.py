Position.py

A position. Stores three numbers: the x,y position as ints
and the tolerance of variance for that position.
-Tolerance must be >= 0. A tolerance of 0 means that
    the position MUST be that exact position.
-Patterns are practically immutable. They cannot be changed
    after being created.
-The distance between two positions is measured in the Manhattan
    metric.

To be used in Patterns and Pattern comparasons (see Pattern.py)
